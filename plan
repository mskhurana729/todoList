Before diving into the code, take a minute to think about how you are going to want to organize your project.

we are going to use webpack to bundle our project and we are gonna create module of every single responsibility.

1. First we have to create a default list named Tasks in which writer can add Tasks.
2. To store lists we will create an array named toDoLists.
3. When ever user click '+ list' button there will be an input asking for list name and there will be a button which will add the list to the array toDoLists.
4. when user selects a list the rendering area will show the tasks inside selected list and will show a button to add task.
5. when user select add task button it will show inputs for title, description , dueDate and priority. There will be a submit button which will call the factory function to create tasks and then add it to that list.
6. In rendering area all the tasks in the list should be displaying and a single task will show Task tittle and its due date and there will be two buttons complete and delete.
7. when clicked on a task it should expand and show its details and also you should be able to edit its details when you click on it.
